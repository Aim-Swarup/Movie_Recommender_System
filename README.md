# Movie Recommender System

## Project Description

This project is a movie recommendation system built with Python and Streamlit. The system recommends movies that are similar to a selected movie. The recommendations are based on a precomputed similarity matrix.

The purpose of this app is to provide movie recommendations based on a selected movie. It uses a precomputed similarity matrix to find movies that are similar to the one selected by the user. The app also fetches and displays movie posters from the TMDB API, providing a visual and interactive experience for the user. This can be particularly useful for movie enthusiasts looking for new movies to watch that are similar to ones they already enjoy. It's like having a personal movie advisor at your fingertips!

## How to Run the App

1. Install the required Python packages: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `requests`, and `pickle`.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the command `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
